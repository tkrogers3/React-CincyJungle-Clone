A clone of CincyJungle.com, a Cincinnati Bengals message board. 

For this project, I used the knowledge I have learned from React and Laravel to create a Full Stack,Front and Back end, application. Starting with the Agile methodology, I began this project by exploring the Cincy Jungle Message Board to see how the site was used as a user, and as a developer.  I wanted to thoughrly map through the site to find ways to make the site my own,enhancing the user interface and making it user friendly. I started off the MVP by creating a MoSCoW list of items I would like my project to include, items that are must haves, could haves, should haves and won't haves. Once I completed this task, I wrote out the MVP for this project. Starting with personas, I created stories based on what a typcial user would want from the website. Once completed, I began to look to aspects of the site that would be requested from a specific user, such as a senior or a superfan. 


I then began to blueprint out frameworks and database tables to the specification of needs for the website. Once these tasks were completed, I was able to begin the project set up for success.
